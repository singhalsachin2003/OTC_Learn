# Production readiness

Written 2026-07-28 from a full pre-production review, worked through on 2026-07-29,
revised on 2026-08-13 for the v1.1 release, and updated 2026-08-16 when v1.1 was
merged to `main` and its first production build cut. **v1.1 targets
Android only** — iOS config and scripts stay in the repo but nothing iOS-specific is
verified or blocking.

v1.1 ships **without crash reporting** — the code is in place and inert. OTA updates
stay on, and the daily reminder is a local notification, so the app's only network
call is a version check against `u.expo.dev` at launch. Both choices are reflected in
`docs/privacy.md` and in the Data safety answers in
`ANDROID_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md`.

## Done

### Pre-production review (2026-07-29)

- `android.versionCode` and `ios.buildNumber` removed from `app.json` — EAS owns both
  under `appVersionSource: "remote"`.
- `verify` runs `format:check` too, and unused path aliases were deleted from
  `babel.config.js`, `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config.js`.
- `ErrorBoundary` wraps `RootNavigator`; errors report through the `track` facade, and
  `errorReporting.ts` installs a Sentry sink only when a DSN is configured.
- Deep links wired up (`useDeepLinks`), and `useQuizExit` confirms before discarding a
  part-finished quiz.
- CI runs `npm run verify` on push and PR; `expo-updates` configured with a channel per
  build profile.
- Artwork redrawn and screenshots captured (`f3d5d2c`), the privacy policy published
  from `/docs` (`e959058`), and the Play Data safety answers written up (`104a74b`,
  `941cf2c`). **These three closed what earlier revisions of this file listed as
  blockers.**

### v1.1 upgrade (2026-08-13)

- Content: every product gained a summary, callouts, six key terms, a worked example,
  an in-practice note and related products; question banks went from 5 to 12 each,
  mixing true/false with four-option multiple choice — 240 questions in total. An
  adversarial accuracy audit ran over all five asset-class files and 13 corrections
  were applied, including a post-LIBOR convention error, an inverted CDS accrual, a
  reversed crack-spread ratio and a question with two defensible answers.
- Quizzes draw a weighted random subset per sitting and shuffle multiple-choice
  options, so a retake is a genuinely different paper.
- Progress moved from a completed flag to mastery (0–100, 0.35 learning rate), with a
  spaced-repetition review queue for missed questions.
- New shell: bottom tabs, a dashboard with SVG rings and a week strip, a product page,
  a products tab with search, a review tab, a profile with settings, a glossary and
  achievements.
- Store screenshots re-shot from the current build on 2026-08-13 (eight screens), the
  listing copy updated, and the Data safety notes extended to cover the notification
  and haptics permissions.
- Storage moved to schema v2 with a migration that carries v1 completed products across
  as mastery records. `clearAll()` finally has a caller — the reset in Profile.
- Four native dependencies added: `react-native-svg`, `expo-haptics`,
  `expo-notifications`, `react-native-reanimated`.
- Version set to **1.1.0**. That starts a new `runtimeVersion` under the `appVersion`
  policy, so installs still on 1.0.0 stop receiving OTA updates until they upgrade —
  which is the correct outcome here rather than a cost, since the four native
  dependencies mean this release could never have shipped over the air anyway. It
  needs a store build.

### v1.1 production build (2026-08-16)

- 14-day/12-tester closed testing completed and Google granted production access —
  on the **1.0.0** build (versionCode 3), predating v1.1. This unlocks the Production
  track for the account; it is not device verification of v1.1 itself, so items 2–4
  below are still open against this specific build.
- `v1.1-mastery-and-review` merged into `main` (`dac9488`) and built: **versionCode 4**,
  `1.1.0`, signed with the existing EAS-managed keystore (`Rk8YiwiZ1s`).
- Blocker 1 verified and closed: `bundletool dump manifest` against the built `.aab`
  (an AAB has no APK for `aapt2` to inspect directly) shows exactly `INTERNET`,
  `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `VIBRATE`, plus the self-scoped
  `DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION` Android generates for a receiver
  registered with `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` — no FCM permissions leaked in.

## Outstanding

No submission blockers remain — see "v1.1 production build" above.

### Verification gaps

1. **Only the happy path has been seen on a device.** Verified on a Pixel 7 emulator on
   2026-08-13: the home dashboard, category, product page, lesson, quiz (both question
   kinds, with option shuffling and feedback), review, glossary and profile. Still
   unexercised on real hardware: the daily reminder actually firing, permission being
   revoked in system settings mid-life, the review queue coming due across a real date
   change, haptics, the lesson swipe gesture, and an `eas update` push. The closed test
   that unlocked production access ran the pre-v1.1 build, so none of this is covered
   by real-user testing either.
2. **Font scaling.** Several styles pin `lineHeight` next to `fontSize`; text may clip
   at the largest accessibility sizes. One pass on a device.
3. **Migration on a real v1 install.** The v1→v2 migration is unit-tested — including
   the case where the write fails part-way, which is where it previously lost data —
   but has not been run against an actual app upgrade on a device holding v1 data.

### Housekeeping

- **Screen-level test coverage is thin** where the logic is thickest in components:
  `SettingsRows` 35%, `QuizTimer` 29%, `ReviewScreen` 39%, `ProfileScreen` 69%,
  `LessonScreen` 71%. Deliberately left after the pure logic, the store and the
  start-up path were taken to 100%: these fail visibly on screen, whereas a wrong
  review interval or a lost answer index fails silently. Worth closing, not urgent.
- **Three formatter helpers are now dead product code** — `formatProductCount`,
  `formatProgressLabel` and `progressPercent` in `utils/formatters.ts` are unused by
  the app since the mastery rewrite, though still covered by their own tests. Delete
  them with their tests, or find them a caller.

### Deferred by choice

- **Crash reporting.** v1.1 ships dark: the Sentry code is merged and tested but no DSN
  is set, and the native SDK sets `io.sentry.auto-init` to `false`, so it is genuinely
  dormant. Turning it on later is three steps, in this order: update `docs/privacy.md`,
  update the Play Data safety form to declare **Crash logs**, then set
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production` as EAS build secrets.
  Also add the `@sentry/react-native/expo` config plugin, or stack traces arrive
  minified. Sentry is native code, so it needs a new build — an OTA update cannot
  switch it on.
- **iOS.** Scripts, `bundleIdentifier` and config remain, unverified. Revisit after
  Android ships.
- **Review mode does not move mastery.** A deliberate choice, documented in the README:
  four scattered questions across four products is not a measurement of any one
  product. Worth revisiting if users find it confusing.
