/**
 * Promote a build to the production track. Run with `npm run promote` — which
 * changes nothing. Pass `--commit` to publish.
 *
 * ```bash
 * npm run promote                            # show what would change
 * npm run promote -- --commit                # full rollout
 * npm run promote -- --rollout=0.2 --commit  # staged, 20% of users
 * ```
 *
 * **This is the only script here that reaches real users.** Everything else touches
 * a test track, a draft product or a dashboard. So it prints the before and after,
 * refuses several ways to get it wrong, and needs `--commit` to do anything.
 *
 * **What it refuses:**
 *
 * - A versionCode that is not already on a testing track. Production should receive
 *   something that has been installed somewhere first, never a fresh artifact.
 * - A versionCode lower than or equal to what production already serves.
 * - Release notes over Play's 500-character cap, which is rejected on commit anyway.
 * - Running at all if the release notes still read like Expo's placeholder — the
 *   production listing has carried "First release of this awesome app." since v1.0
 *   because `eas submit` writes that when nothing is supplied.
 *
 * **What it cannot check, and you must have done first:** Data Safety must declare
 * what this app collects, and Sign-in details must say Yes and carry the reviewer's
 * route. Both are Console-only — no API reaches them. A build that collects data its
 * listing denies collecting is the under-declaring direction, and that is what Play
 * suspends apps for. Cornerstone's listing said "No data collected" for an app that
 * stores an email address until 2026-09-25, so this is not hypothetical.
 *
 * Ported from Cornerstone on 2026-09-25, in JavaScript because this repo's scripts
 * are. Two differences, both in where things live: the package, and release notes
 * read from `STORE_LISTING.md` at the repo root rather than under `docs/`.
 *
 * **The service account needs a per-app grant to release.** It had six permissions
 * on this app and ten on Cornerstone, and `eas submit` failed with "missing the
 * necessary permissions" until Releases → "Release to production" and "Release apps
 * to testing tracks" were ticked for it in Console → Users and permissions.
